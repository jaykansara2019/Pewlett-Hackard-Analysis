# **Silver Tsunami - An employee database analysis**

## **Purpose** 
The analysis aims to find the number of employees who will be eligible for retirement from each department and the number of employees who are eligible for the mentorship programme at Pewelett-Hackard.


## **Results**

### ***Deliverable 1***
- For Deliverable one, we applied three different queries to get the number of employees who are retiring. The data in the number of retiring employees table was curated further to get the unique number of employees. The initial table 'Retiring employees' had duplicate entiries. This is because one employee might have held multiple positions during their tenure at Pewelett-Hackard.

- We also got a count of the number of employees retiring based on the job title. This granular level of analysis will help the recruiting managers to be prepared for the upcoming hiring process. The final outcome looked like below:

### ***Deliverable 2***

- For deliverable 2, we have derived the number of employees eligible for the mentorship programme. These are all the employees who were born between 01-Jan-1965 to 31-Dec-1065.
